══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    BRAZILIAN KERATIN TREATMENT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
A semi-permanent smoothing treatment that infuses keratin protein into the hair 
cuticle to eliminate frizz, reduce curl pattern, and create smooth, shiny hair.

WHY CHOOSE THIS TREATMENT:
• Eliminates up to 95% of frizz and flyaways
• Reduces styling time by 50-70%
• Makes hair more manageable and easier to style
• Creates a smooth, glossy finish
• Reduces blow-dry time significantly
• Helps repair and strengthen damaged hair
• Protects hair from humidity and environmental damage

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Frizzy, unmanageable hair (all types)
✓ Wavy to curly hair wanting smoother texture
✓ Thick, coarse hair needing control
✓ Color-treated hair (wait 2 weeks after coloring)
✓ Anyone wanting to reduce daily styling time
✓ Humidity-prone hair
✓ Heat-damaged hair seeking repair

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
✗ Extremely damaged, over-processed hair (may need repair first)
✗ Fine, thin hair (may become too flat)
✗ Pregnant or nursing women (formaldehyde concerns)
✗ Scalp conditions or open wounds
✗ Immediate post-bleaching (wait 3 weeks)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Hair is deeply cleansed to remove all product buildup
2. Keratin solution is applied section by section
3. Solution penetrates hair shaft, filling gaps in damaged cuticle
4. Hair is blow-dried to set the keratin
5. Flat iron at 450°F seals the keratin into hair structure
6. Creates a protective layer around each hair strand
7. Keratin bonds to hair, creating smooth, frizz-free texture

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (3-4 Hours):
STEP 1: Clarifying Wash (15 minutes)
   - Deep cleansing shampoo removes all buildup
   - Opens hair cuticle for keratin absorption
   
STEP 2: Application (60-90 minutes)
   - Hair divided into small sections
   - Keratin formula applied from roots to ends
   - Each section carefully saturated
   - Longer/thicker hair takes more time

STEP 3: Processing (30 minutes)
   - Product sits on hair to penetrate
   - Keratin molecules bond with hair structure

STEP 4: Blow-Dry (30-45 minutes)
   - Hair is 100% dried on medium heat
   - Helps set the keratin treatment

STEP 5: Flat Iron Sealing (45-60 minutes)
   - Each thin section flat-ironed 5-7 times
   - High heat (450°F) seals keratin into hair
   - Creates smooth, glossy finish

BENEFITS YOU'LL EXPERIENCE:
• Immediately smoother, shinier hair
• 50-70% reduction in styling time
• Frizz-free hair even in humidity

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        OLAPLEX TREATMENT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
A revolutionary bond-building treatment that repairs broken disulfide bonds in 
hair at the molecular level. Works on the internal structure of hair, not just 
the surface.

WHY THIS TREATMENT IS IMPORTANT:
• Only treatment that actually repairs hair from inside
• Not a protein or moisture treatment - it's bond repair
• Rebuilds broken molecular bonds in hair
• Reverses chemical, heat, and mechanical damage
• Makes impossible hair transformations possible
• Prevents breakage during chemical services
• Cumulative benefits - hair gets better over time

WHAT ARE DISULFIDE BONDS:
Hair is made of keratin protein chains held together by disulfide bonds - like 
ladder rungs connecting the sides. These bonds give hair its strength, structure, 
and integrity. When hair is damaged (bleach, color, heat, chemicals), these bonds 
break, causing:
• Breakage and brittleness
• Loss of elasticity
• Dryness and dullness
• Rough texture
• Inability to hold moisture
• Color fading
• Unmanageable hair

OLAPLEX RECONNECTS THESE BROKEN BONDS - literally rebuilding hair structure.

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Chemically treated hair (color, bleach, highlights)
✓ Heat-damaged hair from styling tools
✓ Breaking, brittle hair
✓ Hair that won't hold moisture
✓ Over-processed, damaged hair
✓ Before/during/after bleaching (protection + repair)
✓ Anyone with any type of damage
✓ Even healthy hair (strengthens and protects)

SUITABLE FOR ALL HAIR TYPES:
✓ All textures (straight, wavy, curly, coily)
✓ All hair types (fine, medium, thick)
✓ Color-treated and virgin hair
✓ Bleached and natural hair
✓ Extensions (yes!)

NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR:
✗ Moisture (still need conditioner)
✗ Protein (different purpose)
✗ Keratin smoothing
✗ Deep conditioning (use together for best results)

HOW IT WORKS:
STEP 1: Single Bonds Searching
   - Olaplex molecules search for broken disulfide bonds
   - Identifies damaged areas in hair structure

STEP 2: Bond Reconnection
   - Olaplex reconnects broken bonds
   - Rebuilds hair's internal structure
   - Strengthens from the inside

STEP 3: Prevention
   - Creates network of bonds
   - Protects against future damage
   - Maintains bond integrity

THE TREATMENT PROCESS:

STAND-ALONE OLAPLEX TREATMENT (45-60 minutes):
STEP 1: Hair Assessment (5 minutes)
   - Evaluate damage level

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        K18 MOLECULAR REPAIR TREATMENT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
A biotech breakthrough treatment that repairs damage to hair's keratin structure 
at the molecular level using a patented peptide technology. Works in just 4 minutes.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Fastest professional repair treatment available
• Repairs damage from the inside out
• Targets multiple types of hair damage simultaneously
• Uses biomimetic peptide that reaches core of hair
• Reverses damage, not just masks it
• 4-minute processing time (revolutionary speed)
• Clinically proven to repair damage

HOW K18 DIFFERS FROM OLAPLEX:
OLAPLEX:
- Repairs disulfide bonds specifically
- Takes 20-30 minutes to process
- Works on one type of bond

K18:
- Repairs polypeptide chains (keratin structure)
- Takes only 4 minutes to process
- Works on multiple damage types simultaneously
- Different mechanism = can use both together

THINK OF IT THIS WAY:
- OLAPLEX = Repairs the "ladder rungs" (bonds between chains)
- K18 = Repairs the "ladder sides" (the chains themselves)
- Together = Complete hair repair from all angles

WHAT ARE POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS:
Hair is made of keratin protein chains (polypeptides). These chains are the 
actual structure of hair. When damaged by chemicals, heat, or mechanical stress:
• Chains break apart
• Hair loses internal structure
• Becomes weak and brittle
• Can't hold moisture
• Loses elasticity

K18 RECONNECTS AND REBUILDS THESE KERATIN CHAINS.

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Severely bleached or chemically damaged hair
✓ Heat-damaged hair from excessive styling
✓ Hair that feels "gummy" or overly elastic
✓ Brittle, snapping hair
✓ Hair with multiple types of damage
✓ Quick service needed (4-minute processing!)
✓ All hair types and textures
✓ Hair that hasn't responded to other treatments

SUITABLE FOR:
✓ All hair types (straight, wavy, curly, coily)
✓ Color-treated and virgin hair
✓ Fine to thick hair
✓ Natural and textured hair
✓ Hair extensions

THE SCIENCE:
K18 uses a patented peptide (K18Peptide™) that:
1. Is small enough to penetrate to hair's core
2. Mimics hair's natural building blocks
3. Reconnects broken keratin chains
4. Rebuilds hair's polypeptide structure
5. Restores hair's strength, elasticity, and resilience

HOW IT WORKS:
STEP 1: Penetration (Minute 1-2)
   - K18Peptide is smaller than other proteins
   - Reaches innermost layers of hair cortex
   - Navigates through damaged areas

STEP 2: Recognition (Minute 2-3)
   - Peptide recognizes broken keratin chains
   - Attaches to damage sites
   - Begins reconnection process

STEP 3: Reconnection (Minute 3-4)
   - Peptide acts like "molecular glue"
   - Reforms broken keratin chains
   - Rebuilds hair's internal structure
   - Restores strength and elasticity

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (30 minutes total):

STEP 1: Cleansing (10 minutes)
   - Hair washed with detox shampoo
   - Removes all buildup and barriers
   - Ensures peptide can penetrate

STEP 2: K18 Application (5 minutes)
   - Hair towel-dried to damp
   - K18 Leave-In Mask applied section by section
   - Worked through thoroughly from roots to ends
   - Amount depends on damage level and hair length

STEP 3: Processing (4 minutes)
   - NO RINSING
   - Leave product on hair
   - Peptide actively repairing during these 4 minutes
   - This is when magic happens!

STEP 4: Style (10 minutes)
   - Proceed directly to styling
   - No washing out required
   - Product remains in hair
   - Blow-dry or air dry
   - Style as desired

BENEFITS YOU'LL EXPERIENCE:
IMMEDIATE (After First Treatment):
• Softer, smoother hair texture
• Reduced frizz
• Improved manageability
• Better elasticity (hair bounces back)
• Easier detangling
• Restored movement and body

AFTER 2-3 TREATMENTS:

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    DEEP CONDITIONING TREATMENT (HYDRATING)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
An intensive moisture treatment that deeply hydrates and nourishes hair using 
concentrated conditioning agents, natural oils, and moisture-binding ingredients.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Restores moisture to dry, dehydrated hair
• Improves softness and manageability
• Adds shine and luster
• Reduces frizz caused by dryness
• Improves elasticity and flexibility
• Prevents breakage from dryness
• Makes hair easier to style

WHAT IS HAIR MOISTURE:
Healthy hair contains 10-13% water content. When hair loses moisture:
• Becomes dry, brittle, and rough
• Develops frizz and flyaways
• Loses shine and appears dull
• Becomes difficult to style
• More prone to breakage
• Tangles easily

DEEP CONDITIONING REPLENISHES THIS MOISTURE.

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Dry, dehydrated hair
✓ Rough, coarse texture
✓ Frizzy hair from dryness
✓ Color-treated hair (loses moisture)
✓ Sun or heat damaged hair
✓ Over-washed hair
✓ Naturally dry hair types
✓ Winter-damaged hair
✓ Regular maintenance for healthy hair

SIGNS YOU NEED DEEP CONDITIONING:
• Hair feels straw-like or rough
• Excessive tangling
• Dull, lackluster appearance
• Flyaways and static
• Difficulty retaining moisture
• Dry, itchy scalp
• Hair breaks when stretched

HOW IT WORKS:
Deep conditioners contain:

1. HUMECTANTS (Draw moisture in)
   - Glycerin, honey, aloe vera
   - Attract water molecules to hair
   - Keep moisture locked in

2. EMOLLIENTS (Seal moisture)
   - Natural oils (argan, coconut, jojoba)
   - Smooth hair cuticle
   - Create protective barrier

3. PROTEINS (Strengthen)
   - Keratin, silk, wheat proteins
   - Fill gaps in damaged cuticle
   - Add strength while moisturizing

4. CONDITIONING AGENTS
   - Soften and smooth hair
   - Improve manageability
   - Enhance shine

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (45 minutes):

STEP 1: Cleansing (10 minutes)
   - Hair washed with hydrating shampoo
   - Gentle cleanse without stripping
   - Removes buildup to allow penetration

STEP 2: Application (10 minutes)
   - Excess water removed from hair
   - Deep conditioner applied generously
   - Focused on mid-lengths to ends
   - Roots avoided (can be heavy)
   - Worked through with wide-tooth comb

STEP 3: Heat Processing (20 minutes)
   - Hair covered with cap/wrap
   - Heat applied (steamer or heat cap)
   - Heat opens cuticle for deeper penetration
   - Allows maximum moisture absorption

STEP 4: Cooling (5 minutes)
   - Hair cools to close cuticle
   - Seals in moisture
   - Locks in benefits

STEP 5: Rinse & Style
   - Rinsed with cool water
   - Light styling product applied
   - Blow-dry or air dry
   - Immediately noticeable softness

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        PROTEIN TREATMENT (STRENGTH & REPAIR)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
A reconstructive treatment that replenishes lost protein in damaged hair structure, 
rebuilding strength, elasticity, and resilience using concentrated protein formulas.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Rebuilds hair's structural integrity
• Restores strength to weakened hair
• Improves elasticity (hair's ability to stretch without breaking)
• Reduces breakage and split ends
• Fills gaps in damaged hair cuticle
• Prepares hair for chemical services
• Essential for chemically processed hair

UNDERSTANDING HAIR PROTEIN:
Hair is 90-95% keratin protein. Hair structure is like a brick wall:
• Keratin proteins = Bricks
• Moisture = Mortar
• Both needed for strong hair

When protein is lost (from damage), hair becomes:
• Weak and limp
• Stretchy and gummy
• Excessively elastic
• Prone to breakage
• Unable to hold style
• Lacking body and volume

PROTEIN TREATMENTS REBUILD THIS STRUCTURE.

HOW PROTEIN IS LOST:
• Chemical processing (color, bleach, relaxers)
• Heat styling (flat irons, curling irons, blow dryers)
• Mechanical damage (brushing, tight styles)
• Environmental factors (sun, chlorine, salt water)
• Age and natural wear
• Over-moisturizing without protein balance

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Chemically treated hair (color, bleach, highlights)
✓ Heat-damaged hair from styling tools
✓ Hair that stretches excessively when wet
✓ Limp, lifeless hair lacking body
✓ Hair that won't hold curls or styles
✓ Breaking or splitting hair
✓ Over-moisturized hair (yes, too much moisture is possible!)
✓ Hair feeling "mushy" or gummy
✓ Pre-treatment before chemical services

SIGNS YOU NEED PROTEIN:
TEST: Take wet hair strand and gently stretch it
• Healthy hair: Stretches 30-40% and returns to normal
• Needs protein: Stretches 50%+ and doesn't return, feels gummy
• Too much protein: Won't stretch, feels brittle and stiff

Other signs:
• Hair feels like wet noodles
• Lacks body and volume
• Won't hold curl
• Excessive tangling
• Breakage during combing
• Split ends throughout
• Limp, flat appearance

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
✗ Hair that's already protein-overloaded (stiff, brittle)
✗ Very dry hair (moisturize first)
✗ Low porosity hair (use with caution, lighter proteins)

THE BALANCE:
Hair needs BOTH moisture AND protein:
• Too much moisture + no protein = Weak, stretchy, gummy
• Too much protein + no moisture = Brittle, stiff, breaking
• Perfect balance = Strong, elastic, healthy

TYPES OF PROTEINS USED:

HYDROLYZED PROTEINS (Penetrating):
• Small molecules penetrate hair shaft
• Keratin, collagen, silk proteins
• Rebuild internal structure
• Best for: Severe damage

LARGER PROTEINS (Coating):
• Coat hair surface
• Wheat, soy, oat proteins
• Strengthen cuticle layer
• Best for: Mild damage

AMINO ACIDS (Building blocks):
• Smallest protein components
• Easily absorbed
• Support protein synthesis
• Best for: All hair types

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (50-60 minutes):

STEP 1: Hair Assessment (5 minutes)
   - Evaluate protein needs
   - Test hair elasticity
   - Determine protein type and strength needed

STEP 2: Cleansing (10 minutes)
   - Clarifying shampoo removes buildup
   - Opens cuticle for protein penetration
   - Prepares hair for treatment

STEP 3: Application (10 minutes)
   - Hair towel-dried
   - Protein treatment applied section by section
   - Concentrated on most damaged areas
   - Worked through thoroughly

STEP 4: Processing with Heat (20-25 minutes)
   - Hair covered with cap
   - Heat applied (steamer or heat cap)
   - Heat drives proteins into hair shaft
   - Proteins bond to damaged areas

STEP 5: Cool Down (5 minutes)
   - Hair cools naturally
   - Cuticle closes, sealing in proteins
   - Strengthening solidifies

STEP 6: Rinse & Balance (5 minutes)
   - Rinsed with cool water
   - Light conditioner applied to balance
   - Moisture added to complement protein

STEP 7: Style (5 minutes)
   - Blow-dry or air dry
   - Immediately feel stronger hair

HOW PROTEINS WORK:
1. Small protein molecules penetrate hair cortex
2. Fill in gaps and holes in damaged structure
3. Bond to existing keratin in hair
4. Create network of strengthened areas
5. Rebuild hair's structural integrity
6. Restore elasticity and resilience

BENEFITS YOU'LL EXPERIENCE:
IMMEDIATE:
• Hair feels stronger and firmer
• Improved body and volume
• Better texture and structure
• Reduced breakage when handling

AFTER 1-2 WEEKS:
• Significantly stronger hair
• Improved elasticity
• Better curl retention
• Reduced breakage and splitting
• Hair holds styles better

CONTINUED USE:
• Progressive strengthening

• Healthier appearance overall

FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Severely damaged hair: Every 2-3 weeks
• Moderately damaged: Monthly
• Color-treated: Every 3-4 weeks
• Heat-styled: Every 3-4 weeks
• Normal hair: Every 6-8 weeks
• Natural textured hair: Every 4-6 weeks

PROTEIN-MOISTURE BALANCE SCHEDULE:
Week 1: Protein treatment
Week 2: Deep conditioning (moisture)
Week 3: Light conditioner only
Week 4: Deep conditioning (moisture)
Repeat cycle

AFTERCARE:
MUST BALANCE WITH MOISTURE:
• Follow protein with deep conditioning within 3-7 days
• Use moisturizing conditioner after every wash
• Apply leave-in conditioner
• Don't overdo protein (can cause brittleness)
• Watch for signs of protein overload

SIGNS OF TOO MUCH PROTEIN (Protein Overload):
• Hair feels stiff and crunchy
• Increased breakage
• Dry, rough texture
• Won't curl or loses curl pattern
• Tangles excessively

FIX: Stop protein treatments, focus on moisture for 2-4 weeks

AT-HOME MAINTENANCE:

                        SPLIT END SEALING TREATMENT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
A specialized treatment that temporarily seals and smooths split ends using 
concentrated proteins and sealants, extending time between haircuts while 
improving appearance.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Temporarily seals split ends
• Prevents further splitting up the hair shaft
• Smooths rough, frayed ends
• Improves overall appearance
• Extends time between trims
• Makes hair more manageable
• Reduces tangling at ends

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND:
Split ends CANNOT be permanently repaired - only cutting removes them completely. 
However, this treatment:
• Temporarily fuses split ends back together
• Prevents splits from traveling up hair shaft
• Buys time before next haircut
• Improves appearance significantly

WHAT ARE SPLIT ENDS:
Split ends (trichoptilosis) occur when the protective cuticle at hair ends 
wears away, causing the hair shaft to split into 2 or more strands.

TYPES OF SPLIT ENDS:
• Traditional split: Hair splits into 2 strands
• Tree split: Multiple splits from one point
• Fork split: Three-way split
• Feather split: Multiple mini-splits along hair shaft
• Knot split: Hair tangles and creates knot
• Incomplete split: Small crack, not fully split yet

CAUSES OF SPLIT ENDS:
• Heat styling without protection
• Chemical processing (color, bleach, perms)
• Excessive brushing, especially when wet
• Lack of regular trims
• Rough towel drying
• Tight hairstyles causing tension
• Environmental damage (sun, wind, pollution)
• Lack of moisture and protection

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Anyone with split ends (obviously!)
✓ People trying to grow hair long
✓ Those who can't trim frequently
✓ Color-treated hair prone to splitting
✓ Heat-styled hair with damage
✓ Dry, brittle ends
✓ Hair with visible breakage
✓ Between haircut maintenance

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (40-50 minutes):

STEP 1: Assessment (5 minutes)
   - Examine ends for split severity
   - Identify most damaged areas
   - Determine treatment concentration needed

STEP 2: Dusting (10-15 minutes)
   - Very light trim to remove worst splits
   - "Dusting" removes only extreme damage
   - 1/8 to 1/4 inch maximum
   - Preserves length while addressing severe splits

STEP 3: Application (10 minutes)
   - Split end sealing serum applied
   - Concentrated on last 2-3 inches
   - Contains proteins, silicones, and bonding agents
   - Worked through each section thoroughly

STEP 4: Heat Activation (10 minutes)
   - Blow-dryer or flat iron applies heat
   - Heat activates bonding agents
   - Seals split ends temporarily
   - Smooths cuticle layer

STEP 5: Finishing (5 minutes)
   - Smoothing serum applied
   - Protects sealed ends
   - Adds shine and polish

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Bonding proteins penetrate split ends
2. "Glue" split strands back together temporarily
3. Silicones coat and smooth the sealed area
4. Heat sets the seal
5. Protective coating prevents new damage

INGREDIENTS THAT SEAL SPLITS:
• Hydrolyzed proteins (penetrate and bond)
• Silicones (smooth and coat)
• Ceramides (strengthen cuticle)
• Natural oils (add flexibility)
• Polymers (create protective film)

BENEFITS:
• Split ends appear sealed and smooth
• Ends look healthier and more polished
• Reduced tangling
• Less breakage
• Can extend 4-6 weeks between trims
• Hair looks fuller at ends
• Improves styling results

HOW LONG IT LASTS:
• Effects last 3-6 weeks
• Depends on hair care routine
• Gradually wears off with washing and styling
• Repeat treatment recommended monthly
• Best results when combined with regular trims

FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Every 3-4 weeks for maintenance
• Every 2 weeks for severely split ends
• Between haircuts to extend wear
• After chemical services (hair more prone to splitting)

AFTERCARE TO MAINTAIN RESULTS:
MUST DO:
✓ Use heat protectant EVERY TIME before heat styling
✓ Apply leave-in conditioner to ends daily
✓ Use hair oil on ends before bed
✓ Trim every 8-12 weeks (prevents severe splitting)
✓ Gentle handling when hair is wet
✓ Silk/satin pillowcase
✓ Avoid over-washing

AVOID:
✗ Heat styling without protection
✗ Rough towel drying
✗ Brushing wet hair aggressively
✗ Tight hairstyles
✗ Chemical processing without protection

HOME MAINTENANCE:
• Weekly split end serum application
• Regular deep conditioning
• Trimming visible splits yourself (carefully)
• Protective styling
• Night-time hair oil

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:
✓ Temporarily improves appearance
✓ Prevents splits from worsening
✓ Extends time between cuts
✓ Makes hair look healthier

✗ Does NOT permanently fix splits
✗ Will not restore ends to perfect condition
✗ Must be repeated regularly

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    KÉRASTASE PREMIERE TREATMENT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
Advanced treatment specifically designed for damaged and over-processed hair 
caused by calcium buildup. Repairs damage from hard water and restores hair's 
natural health through decalcification and repair.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Removes calcium buildup that causes damage
• Repairs hair damaged by hard water
• Restores hair's natural flexibility
• Repairs color-damaged hair
• Addresses the ROOT CAUSE of certain damage types
• Unique science-based approach
• Visible results after first treatment

UNDERSTANDING CALCIUM DAMAGE:
Most water (85% of homes) is "hard water" containing high calcium levels. When 
you wash hair with hard water:

1. Calcium deposits on hair shaft
2. Creates rigid, stiff build-up
3. Hair loses flexibility
4. Becomes prone to breakage
5. Color fades faster
6. Products don't work as well

This is DIFFERENT from typical damage - it's structural rigidity from mineralization.

SIGNS OF CALCIUM BUILDUP:
• Hair feels rough and stiff
• Lacks flexibility (doesn't move naturally)
• Color looks dull despite recent coloring
• Hair breaks easily, especially when wet
• Products don't seem to work anymore
• Hair won't hold moisture
• Flat iron "drags" when straightening
• Persistent dryness despite conditioning

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Color-treated hair (especially bleached)
✓ Chemically processed hair
✓ Hair exposed to hard water
✓ Stiff, rigid-feeling hair
✓ Hair that breaks easily when wet
✓ Over-processed, damaged hair
✓ Hair lacking flexibility and movement
✓ Dull hair despite treatments

THE SCIENCE - HOW IT WORKS:
PREMIERE uses dual-acid technology:

1. CITRIC ACID:
   - Dissolves calcium deposits
   - Decalcifies hair shaft
   - Removes rigidity-causing minerals
   - "Unlocks" hair for repair

2. GLYCINE:
   - Repairs internal bonds
   - Restores flexibility
   - Rebuilds hair structure
   - Strengthens from within

Together they:
• Remove the calcium causing stiffness
• Repair the damage underneath
• Restore hair's natural properties

THE TREATMENT PROCESS (60 minutes):

STEP 1: Hair Analysis (5 minutes)
   - Assess calcium damage level
   - Test hair flexibility
   - Identify processing history
   - Determine treatment intensity

STEP 2: Decalcifying Pre-Treatment (15 minutes)
   - Première Concentré applied
   - Targets calcium deposits
   - Begins decalcification process
   - Works to dissolve buildup

STEP 3: Shampoo (10 minutes)
   - Première Bain Décalcifiant shampoo
   - Continues removing calcium
   - Deep cleanses while repairing
   - Prepares for next step

STEP 4: Repairing Treatment (20 minutes)
   - Première Fondant or Masque applied
   - Deep repair phase
   - Restores flexibility and strength
   - Heat may be applied for penetration

STEP 5: Neutralizing (5 minutes)
   - Première Concentré Neutralisant applied
   - Balances pH
   - Seals repair
   - Locks in benefits

STEP 6: Finish & Style (5 minutes)
   - Protective styling products
   - Blow-dry or air dry
   - Immediate transformation visible

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR HAIR:

DURING TREATMENT:
• Calcium deposits dissolve
• Hair becomes more flexible
• Stiffness disappears
• Natural movement returns

IMMEDIATELY AFTER:
• Hair feels lighter
• Moves more naturally
• Softer, smoother texture
• Improved manageability

AFTER 24-48 HOURS:
• Continued improvement
• Significantly reduced breakage

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT IS:
Medical-grade treatment targeting dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) using 
antifungal, exfoliating, and soothing ingredients to eliminate flakes, reduce 
itching, and restore healthy scalp balance.

UNDERSTANDING DANDRUFF:
Dandruff is caused by Malassezia fungus overgrowth on scalp, causing:
• Rapid skin cell turnover
• Visible white/yellow flakes
• Itching and irritation
• Inflammation
• Possible hair loss if severe

DIFFERENCE FROM DRY SCALP:
• Dandruff flakes: Larger, oily, yellowish
• Dry scalp flakes: Small, dry, white
• Dandruff: Fungal cause, needs antifungal treatment
• Dry scalp: Needs moisture

CAUSES OF DANDRUFF:
• Malassezia fungus (primary cause)
• Oily scalp (fungus feeds on oil)
• Stress
• Hormonal changes
• Weather changes
• Product sensitivity
• Infrequent washing
• Certain health conditions

IDEAL FOR:
✓ Persistent dandruff

   - Begins killing fungus

STEP 3: Gentle Exfoliation (10 minutes)
   - Soft scalp brush removes flakes
   - Doesn't irritate or damage
   - Clears follicles
   - Prepares for treatment absorption

STEP 4: Medicated Shampoo (10 minutes)
   - Professional-strength antifungal shampoo
   - Left on 5-10 minutes
   - Thoroughly worked through scalp
   - Eliminates fungus

STEP 5: Treatment Mask (10 minutes)

   - Reduces redness and itching
   - Calms irritation
   - Balances scalp pH

STEP 6: Finish

WHAT IT IS:
Advanced treatment combining scalp stimulation, growth-promoting ingredients, 
and professional techniques to encourage healthy hair growth, reduce shedding, 
and improve hair density.

WHY THIS TREATMENT:
• Stimulates dormant hair follicles
• Increases blood circulation to scalp by 300%+
• Delivers growth-promoting nutrients
• Strengthens existing hair

UNDERSTANDING HAIR GROWTH:
Hair grows in 3 phases:
1. ANAGEN (Growth phase): 2-7 years, hair actively growing

3. TELOGEN (Resting/Shedding): 3 months, hair falls out

NORMAL: 85-90% hairs in anagen, 10-15% in telogen
PROBLEM: More hairs enter telogen, fewer in anagen = thinning

GOAL OF TREATMENT:

• Wake up dormant follicles
• Strengthen existing growth
• Improve follicle health

CAUSES OF HAIR THINNING/LOSS:
• Genetics (androgenetic alopecia)
• Hormonal changes
